<h1>Nostalgia with Kindergarten.</h1>
<p>Who don‚Äôt love the days of Kindergarten? It comes from German words Kinder and Garten. Kinder means children and Garten means Garden. I am very much nostalgic when someone asks me about mine‚Äôs kindergarten story. The person who asks me will probably think <i>‚ÄòWhy did I asked him?‚Äô</i> ü§£ü§£. When I see my school‚Äôs portfolio, I feel like I am in my school again. You, probably, will feel the same when you look at your school‚Äôs portfolio. Mostly we studied in kindergarten from 3 years till 5 years. It consist mainly, that I know, Nursery, LKG and UKG.</p>
<h1>Foster Public School, Dehradun</h1> 
<p>I know that school, every corner of it, till date. It was my first school. I didn‚Äôt exactly know what happened in the first day but it would be the <i>rainiest day</i> as I had ever expected.  It was a way too much big building at that time as I was small. I would get lost whenever I went to the building. Front gate was huge, as every <i>‚Äòdehranduni‚Äôs</i> house. The tile was of red color. The building was white with some lines of red color. As we enter, we can see a painting of giraffe on the wall.</p> 
<h2>School Dress</h2>
<p>Summer School Dress was white with some lines of red color. Same as building. Winter was vice versa, it was red with white lines..</p>
<h1>Incidents</h1>
<p>Here are few incidents, <i>whether we are in the professional job or in kindergarten, ‚Äòyade to sabki hi hoti hai..‚Äô</i> <p>~ Subhransu Patra‚Ä¶</p></p>
<h2>‚ÄòNo-Speak‚Äô Incident</h2>
<p>At the age of two and a half year, I joined the Foster Public School. Before that I could not speak a word. My mama and my papa were worried by this. So they decided to admission me to Foster Public School. At first I didn‚Äôt speak a word. I don‚Äôt know whether my teacher would be worried. (OFC, she would)But gradually I learnt to speak‚Ä¶</p>
<h2>Ravana and Cracker</h2>
<p>So what is linked from Ravana with cracker? Read to know‚Ä¶ So here‚Äôs the incident. It was Dusshera, I was getting ready to go to school. Me with my father and my mother went to school. It was cold enough. October month welcomes the cold in Dehradun. We reached the school. Papa took me up and places me between his shoulders. It was the time when Ravana was going to burn. Then suddenly crackers burn and produce unpleasant sound (as for me‚Ä¶). I cried loudly which added to the noise with fear. (Know the reason of crying by reading ‚Äú<a target="blank" href="https://subhransuindia.github.io/Durga-Puja-Experience-in-2021/">Durga Puja Experience: 2021</a>‚Äù <i>‚ÄòViews badhane ki ninja technique‚Äô</i>) So after that incident, I had ‚ÄòPatakhaphobia‚Äô or ‚ÄòCrackerphobia‚Äô or whatever you say, till I was 8 years old. (It is basically <b style="font-weight: 1200;">Phonophobia</b>, fear of loud noise, it is still there)</p>
<h2>Photo frame</h2>
<p>It was a sunny day, our teacher called us for the class photograph. First thing, I was really very much confused where I am going. As told earlier, it was a huge school for me. When I reached the destination, I saw a huge stage. Teacher called the students and made us stand in a row. Now here is a thing, teacher was totally confused where to put the children. After a hour of confuse, teacher arranged the situation. Main part comes here. Being a <i>5 saal ka bhola baccha</i> (innocent child) I thought that the cameraman who is taking the photo had drawn the margin and the text in front of the camera, then clicked the picture and then produced the desired photo. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
There are also many such incidents but that are very cringe.</p>
<h1>Final Goodbye to school..</h1>
<p>Leaving kindergarten was as tough as entering the kindergarten. I attended a half day school. My mother had reached outside the school. I went outside of school. Mama gave me a red pen and told me to give it to the class teacher. I gave it to her and came to my mother. At that time I had no idea that I am leaving the school. So this is the ending story. Whenever I crossed my school, I would see myself near the door and seeing the kids play. (Because, I didn‚Äôt play with anyone) Now I am in Kolkata, I cant see my school but my school is in my heart.</p> 
<p>Share your experience of your kindergarten days in the comment of the recent blog post. So, will be seen in the next few days. Till then, GudBie.</p>
